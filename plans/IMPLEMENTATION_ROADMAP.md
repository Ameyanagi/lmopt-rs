- **Feature Gates**: Use feature gates for optional functionality (e.g., nightly autodiff)

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests for each component
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
- **Benchmark Tests**: Performance benchmarks comparing against reference implementations
- **Property Tests**: Use property-based testing for mathematical properties (where applicable)
- **Test Fixtures**: Create reusable test fixtures for common test cases

### Documentation Strategy

- **API Documentation**: Detailed rustdoc for all public APIs
- **Examples**: Comprehensive examples showcasing functionality
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step tutorials for common use cases
- **Mathematical Background**: Explain mathematical foundations of algorithms
- **Performance Considerations**: Document performance characteristics

## Prioritization Guidelines

1. **Compatibility**: Prioritize compatibility with levenberg-marquardt crate
2. **Core Functionality**: Focus on core functionality before advanced features
